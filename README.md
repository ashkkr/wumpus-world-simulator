# Wumpus World Simulator

A Wumpus World Simulator developed in Javascript, HTML and CSS.

This version is based on propositional logic. It finds routes using DFS and performs inferences using DPLL. When simulated 50 times, the agent captured gold and climbed out 58% of the time, and even when it could not safely capture gold, it safely climbed out.

This project is forked from `https://github.com/thiagodnf/wumpus-world-simulator`, which developed the game simulator; this project focuses on the agent simulator.

## Wumpus?
Hunt the Wumpus is an early computer game, based on a simple hide and seek format featuring a mysterious monster (the Wumpus) that lurks deep inside a network of rooms. It was originally a text-based game written in BASIC. It has since been ported to various programming languages and platforms including graphical versions.
